For a few years now, there have been fears about automation's effect on the availability and quality of jobs to humans. From [Elon Musk][1] to [US presidential candidates][2], or [famous youtubers][3] there's serious concern that automation, especially with recent developments in AI, might cause long run unemployment at massive scales.

This article will explain the effects of automation, and debunk myths surrounding it. You will about learn about the economics of the labor force, and how they changed in the last 30 or so years. Finally, I'll propose some policies you should support to improve the world.

Automation includes almost all technological progress since the first [industrial revolution][4]. It's such a broad and complex topic, we can barely talk about the economic effects of automating work without talking about the broader [economics of labor][5]. Be skeptical of anyone trying to sell a simple "grand unified theory" of automation's effect on unemployment. Such a person is a crank or trying to sell you something.

# Part 1: The Facts

### 1) We automate tasks, not jobs

A job is made from of a bundle of tasks. For example, [O*NET][6] defines the job of [post-secondary architecture teacher][7] as including 21 tasks like advising students, preparing course materials and conducting original research.

Technology automates tasks, not jobs. When you read an alarmist headline like ["Study finds nearly half of jobs are vulnerable to automation"][8], you need to put it in context: nearly half of all jobs **contain tasks ripe for automation**.

Some of an architecture professor's tasks are easier to automate (grading assignments) and others are harder (advising students). According to [Brynjolfsson and Mitchell][9] tasks "ripe for automation" are tasks that:

*   The task provides clear feedback with clearly definable goals and metrics

*   Large digital datasets can be created containing input-output pairs for the task

*   No long chains of logic or reasoning that depend on diverse background knowledge or common sense

*   No specialized dexterity, physical skills, or mobility required

[Moravec's paradox][10] tells us that some tasks are extremely difficult to automate with computers and machine learning. It's easier for a computer to learn to beat grandmaster humans at chess or Starcraft than it is to do gardening on a windy afternoon. This is true even though most humans can do basic gardening and very few can play high level chess. Moravec's paradox is explained when we understand that gardening requires learning sensorimotor skills that mammals have evolved over billions of years, whereas learning Chess only means learning a short ruleset some humans developped when they were bored.

Some other tasks don't require dexterity, but require the sort of cross-task general intelligence that we [simply can't encode][11] into a machine process (with or without machine learning). "Conducting Original Research" is a good example of this.

Lastly, some tasks are simply bad candidates for automation because they're not very repetitive and too context driven for automation to be economic:

**---->XKCD PLOT<---**

https://xkcd.com/1319/

**----> /XKCD PLOT <-----**

Automating a task within a job doesn't mean the job will stop existing. It's impossible to predict the effects -- the number of people employed and the wage of those workers can both go up or down depending on economic factors we'll discuss in section **XXX**.

### 3) Humans are not horses

CGP Grey's [Humans Need Not Apply][12] makes a famous argument: humans today are in the same position horses were in the 1910s. That is, humans are about to be entirely redundant and replaced by machines which can do everything a human can, but more efficiently.

This argument is wrong and uninformed. Horses have only ever served very few economic tasks: transporting heavy loads, transporting humans faster than foot travel, and recreational uses. With the invention of the combustion engine, two of those three tasks are automated, and horses became almost exclusively a recreational object. This means horses populations decreased over time, because they were no longer needed for labor (the human equivalent to that depopulation would be mass, long term unemployment).

Humans can do lots of tasks ([O*NET][6] lists around 20,000). Even though most jobs contain some tasks that can be automated, [most tasks themselves are not suitable for automation][13], with machine learning or otherwise.

It's also important to realize that automating a task means broader economic changes. It can change what jobs exist, by redefining which tasks are worth bundling together. It can create entirely new tasks (eg. managing the new automated processes).

**-------> Tasks graphic <------------**

A graphic with various tasks in boxes, which are bundled up in jobs.

After automation, some of those tasks are replaced with robot heads (automation) The job definitions shift and new tasks are created (some are related to managing automated tasks)

**-------> / Tasks graphic <---------**

Automating a task does not mean there is "one fewer" task to be done in the economy. This line of thinking is called the [lump of labor fallacy][14]. Any argument whose logic assumes there's a finite amount of work in the economy is incorrect because of that fallacy.

A classic example showing why this is wrong is the industrial revolution. Before the invention of the steam engine more than [95% of humans were employed on farms][15], whereas today this number is around 2%. The remaining 93% of the population didn't go out of a job -- automating this work freed up the labor force to be put to more productive use over time. Some went to school instead of working on the family farm, some started working in factories, etc. Over time, the labor force reallocated away from agriculture.

**Sidenote:** The keen reader at this point will ask: *"if there's an infinite amount of work to be done in the economy, how is there any unemployment at all?"* The main reason is that it takes some time to find a job. If everyone who wants work either has a job or is looking for work, the economy is said to be at the [natural rate of unemployment][16]. Unemployment rates above that "natural" number are consided to be "a bad thing".

### 4) Automation can help or hurt depending on who you are

If technology automates some important task in your job, the effect will be different different depending on your economic status. The main factors are what job you do, where you are geographically, what your education level is, your level of wealth and your social connections.

It's almost impossible to know a priori what the effect will be. Let's take the example of a radiologist, where a core task of the job (making diagnoses based on X-Ray images) is [soon automated](). What won't happen is "radiologists don't exist anymore" -- they have [28 other tasks to work on][17] which aren't automated. That said, several scenarios can play out:

*   A radiologist now sees many additional clients, because their workload per client is reduced. Existing radiologists make more money.

*   People don't want/need more radiology services. Because a radiologist's workload is reduced, there are fewer radiologists. Existing radiologists become unemployed while looking for new specialties

*   People don't want/need more radiology services. Existing radiologists can't/don't find new specialties. We have as many radiologists, but they're paid less.

As we see, in the same case, our radiologist can end up making more money, less money and keep his job, or lose his job entirely. Which scenario plays out depends on economic factors like the [elasticity of supply/demand][18], the [substitution effect][19], the [income effect][20].

Here is another example. When ATMs were introduced to banks, people thought bank tellers would quickly stop existing. While each bank branch employed fewer tellers, more bank branches opened, and there were eventuallly [more bank teller jobs over all][21]

--> graph of ATM vs bank tellers here https://voxeu.org/sites/default/files/image/FromMay2014/bessenfig1.png <----

This is to show that it's extremely difficult to predict the effect of automating a task on the workers who do that task a priori. Because automation is a wide-ranging force in the economy, the most effective way to learn which scenarios play out is to instead study the trends in the labor force. This is what we'll do in the next few sections.

### 5) Automation seems to increase inequality

Automating work will always make the country richer on average. This doesn't mean that everyone will get richer -- automation can increase or decrease inequality. But it's important to know that **technological progress always changes the distribution of wealth**. Even if a new technology is a clear improvement on all fronts, the ones profiting from the existing system will be losers. If we made a perfectly clean and renewable energy source, the people profiting from fossil fuels would be poorer, and the distribution of wealth would change to be more equal.

However, as seen in the [inequality FAQ][22], inequality has increased in the last 30 years. This is at least partly because recent technological progress has served to increase, rather than decrease, inequality.

**----> SOME PLOT HERE SHOWING INEQUALITY BAD VERY SAD <-----**

probably from saez & Zucman 2014

https://gabriel-zucman.eu/files/SaezZucman2014.pdf

**----> / SOME PLOT HERE SHOWING INEQUALITY BAD VERY SAD <-----**

There are 3 demographics between which inequality is increasing due to technology: capital owners, high-education workers and low-education workers. We can separate these trends between intra-worker inequality (the gap in income between high versus low education workers) and top income earner inequality (often called the "99% versus the 1%").

First, the inequality between low-income and high-income workers is increasing:

**---> Plot showing bottom 20% vs top 20% income figure 2 from here https://economics.mit.edu/files/16724 <--**

This seems to be due to technology. Automation is mostly attacking tasks in what we would call "middle income" jobs (DAVID AUTOR SOURCE). This fact makes sense with what we learned in section 2. On one hand, lower income jobs are often very manual and dexterous, and Moravec's Paradox protects them from being efficiently automated. On the other end of the scale, managerial and highly specialized tasks in jobs are of the kind that is often very domain driven and non-repetitive that makes them uneconomical to automate.

Second, the inequality between the wealthiest in society and everyone else is also increasing since at least the 1980s:

**----> image 1% vs everyone else <-----**

It's not clear if the worsening top income inequality is entirely because of technological change. There are several trends that might push down the wages of regular workers compared to high income workers:

*   Firms have increasing monopsony power (source) over the workers. Because there are increasingly fewer firms, workers are in a worse barganing position. This means lower wages overall than in a more competitive marketplace.

*   In most large cities, the cost of housing is outpacing the rate of wage growth. While a worker could have the same pay, the inequality between owners and non-owners will increase, and the share of income dedicated to housing will increasing (leaving disposable income lower).

*   In the US, healthcare prices far outpaces wage growth. This means higher health insurance premiums. While a worker's total compensation is increasing, the take-home pay is not increasing at the same rate due to the growing share going to health insurance.

However, we could be automating more than is economically optimal [because of the tax treatment of capital investments][23]. This would reduce the wage of the workers because their bargaining power is reduced in the face of cheap money investing in inefficient automation.

So while

### 7) If you're not a college graduate living in a city, automation probably hurt you

The simplest way to make this point is with the following hard-to-read figure from [here][24]

---> figure 9 from here https://economics.mit.edu/files/16724 <---

The way to read this plot is as follows: each of the 3 charts represent a 20 year period with the x axis being the density of the city they work in, and the y axis the proportion of workers in that city with that education level.

What this chart shows is clear: the labor force is **moving to cities** and **increasing in education**. Take these facts and put them in the context of of the rising gap in income between high and low education workers and rising urban housing prices. This paints a bleak picture for everyone who isn't college educated and working in a large city: lowering wages and diminishing economic prospects.

### 8) Landlords and Colleges are big winners from the above facts

A lot of [ink has been spilled][25] trying to explain the explosion of healthcare prices in the united states. In both health care, education and urban housing the price has grown at a multiple of average income:

---> Chart of education, healthcare, and urban housing vs real wages

https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/college_scost.png

https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/rent-growth-since-1960/

<---

The common issue is bargaining power. You can't negotiate with a hospital when your health is on the line. Similarly, we saw it's increasingly a necessity to both have a college degree and live near a large city to make a good living. As one [economist jokes][26]: *"I could just take all my papers and statistical programs and globally replace hospitals with schools, doctors with teachers and patients with students"*.

Getting a college degree leads to much higher wages. This means people are ready to pay more for a college degree. Colleges see the value of their product sold increase. Colleges increase prices to match the new value and pocket the difference.

The same dynamic applies with housing in large cities. The demand for metro-area housing is increasing sharply, and the supply is not growing much, due to zoning regulations and other NIMBY politics. Over time, those who own existing urban residences will profit at the expense of all others.

Explanations that get lost in details about college administrative costs or larger home sizes lose the forest for the trees: the administrative costs and larger homes are a way in which the value of a college degree is being captured, not a fundamental cause.

### 9) The market value of a college diplomas has massively increased

A college diploma provides 3 main benefits: hard knowledge, social connections, and a market signal (proof that you can complete a university degree). The economic value of the diploma is going to be a ratio of those 3 factors depending on the exact diploma [footnote] For instance, an engineering degree might provide lots of hard knowledge, little connections and a decent market signal from being officially a professional engineer. On the other hand, a MBA might mostly provide social connections [/footnote].

I would argue that the hard knowledge being learned in school is [has not changed in the last few decades:

https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/primary_scost.gif

Similarly, it's hard to honestly argue that students meet exponentially more peers in college now than they did in the 1960s. 

However, both the wages of those graduating college, and the cost of going to college are growing fast. 

All of this leads to one conclusion: *the market value of the signal a college degree provides has massively increased in the last 30 years.* 

It's not clear why the signal is worth more. But it doesn't mean we can't do something about it! We've known about market signalling [since the 1970s](https://msu.edu/~conlinmi/teaching/EC860/signallingscreening/SpenceQJE1973.pdf). An important insight in the topic is that the cost of the signal is bore by the one emitting the signal. In education terms this implies colleges can charge more and that the student are necessarily the ones footing the bill. 

### 10) Automation and free trade have similar effects on labor

This is a sidenote, but will help organize your thoughts on economic trends. Imagine this scenario: you do menial work in a factory. One day, your boss comes in and tells you one of the following:

*   "This factory is being relocated to a country where wages are 1/20ths of yours, you're fired."

*   "Your job is being replaced by the new *WorkaTron9000*, you're fired."

Which would you prefer?

The answer, of course, is that you don't really care -- you're out of a job either way.

In both the cases of free trade and automation, we replace what was previously done by labor with capital. In the case of trade, we do it by giving the money to people in an other country in exchange for the task being completed. In the automation case, we do it by giving money to people to make machines to complete the task.

In fact, even though automation and trade have similar effects on unemployment, there is a [strong argument][27] that trade has had a much larger impact on employment in the US in the last 20 years. The reason for this is that [trade with China][28] has had a large effect on US manufacturing employment, much [more so than automation][29].

Both trade and automation are fundamental drivers of modern economic growth. Both create more wealth, but also change the distribution of income in society, which can (and generally do) increase inequality. In fact even the [simplest trade models][30] predict that inequality increases -- trade creates winners and losers, but winners always [gain more than losers lose][31]. In theory, we could compensate the ones losing from taxing the winners' increased wealth, but in practice this generally seems lost in the political process. In the words of [Autor, Dorn & Hansen][32]:

> Without question, a worker’s position in the wage distribution is indicative of her exposure to import competition. In response to a given trade shock, a lower-wage employee experiences larger proportionate reductions in annual and lifetime earnings, a diminished ability to exit a job before an adverse shock hits, and a greater likelihood of exiting the labor market, relative to her higher-wage coworker.

### XXX) Rural communities do not recover well to unemployment shocks

[Autor, Dorn & Hansen][32] show that rural communities with an economy vulnerable to trade with China (imagine the stereotypical factory town) have had lower wages and labor force participation a full decade after the "China shock" on their local economy. This paints a bleak picture for the ones living in the affected communities -- while we would expect the losers from a trade deal to eventually find equivalent work in other economic sectors, those in rural communities often don't.

It's important to note the other side of this issue. China entering in trade with the global market is one of the greatest welfare gains in recorded human history. It's hard to overstate the impact: it has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty. China's poverty rate fell from [88 percent in 1981 to 0.7 percent in 2015][33].

So the larger issue with trade is that in the same event we can lift hundreds of millions of Chinese out of poverty, raise US GDP overall and economically eviscerate some US rural manufacturing towns. Yet, somehow, we don't adequately compensate the latter from any of the of the hundreds of billions of dollars worth of gains in any of the former.

While the "China Shock" is an outstanding event, the overall trend of economic productivity going from rural areas towards urban areas is ongoing, and the rural areas don't seem to adapt well to this change.

## TAKEAWAYS:

The main idea is that automation creates a lot of economic prosperity. However, this prosperity is not shared equally, and some are even worse off.

### Don't be concerned about hypothetical future unemployment.

**Instead, be concerned about low quality job prospects right now.**

We've seen that while automation is the core engine for economic growth in the last 200 years, in the last 30 years automation has also increased inequality. While we shouldn't be concerned about humans becoming economically useless, we should be concerned about large demographics **feeling useless** due to dire job prospects.

The two groups that are doing well are the highly educated urbanites and "the rich" (roughly the top 0.1% or 1% of the wealth distribution). Both of these groups, but especially the ultra-rich, have had great

Rural demographics and for those with low education have had it the worst. It's not a coincidence that rural inhabitants with low education is one of the only demographics in the last century whose life expectancy [has worsened][34]. This increase in mortality is mostly due to "deaths of despair" (suicide, drug overdose, etc. )

Urban dwellers without a college education are also not particularly better off. Their income is not growing particularly fast. On the other hand, urban costs of living,especially housing, but also education and healthcare rising faster than the income growth.

In short, we're worrying about the imaginary issues automation might cause when there are very real economic issues automation right now. Let's focus on those.

### Growing societal divides aren't just a media creation

All the research we've gone over depicts a society dividing between highly educated urbanites and everyone else. This is reflected in increased political divide, since in two party systems, lines between who votes one color and who votes in another are generally drawn over the rural/urban divide:

---> graph

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/NOMINATE_polarization.jpg

--> /graph

We have to note that "the rural population" has not been a unified block over the decade. Over the decades the rural demographic has gone through self-selection as [almost a third][35] emigrated to cities in the US in the last 50 years. Those who remained in rural areas are necessarily different by being part of the two-thirds who remained in rural areas either economic or cultural reasons.

# Part 2: Solutions

[Furman (2016)][36] proposes the following solutions:

*   Keep investing in AI because the benefits massively outweigh the negatives.

*   Ensure more widely accessible and flexible education for all to prepare for jobs of the future

*   Aid workers in job transitions

*   Ensure that the benefits of automation are broadly shared

Anyone who read up to this point should agree with the above.

Here is additional discussion on some popular proposed solutions:

### Universal Basic Income is not a particularly good answer to automation's problems

From [Elon Musk][37] to Andrew Yang (Source), many advocate for Universal Basic Income (UBI) to act as a safety net against technological unemployment. 

UBI isn't necessarily a bad idea [footnote] UBI is can be mathematically equivalent to most welfare system with taxes coming in and welfare checks coming out. The advantages of UBI are that it's simpler to understand and might be lighter on bureaucracy. The important part is how much we tax and give out at each level of income. In UBI, we give everyone money unconditionally. If we want to help the poor, then comparing to other systems we need to tax less at lower income brackets, and tax more at higher inome brackets, so that the "gift" is offset by higher taxes. [/fotnote]. But we saw before that the problem with automation isn't technological unemployment, it's low quality job prospects from a shifting economy. 

UBI, like any other generous social safety net, would help treat some of the economic symptoms (inequality), but it won't address the root cause (lack of job mobility).

### College debt forgiveness is not a good solution to the student loan crisis

We saw in sections 8 and 9 that the bargaining power of colleges against students has increased and this lets them charge much larger prices than they used to. This adds up to student loans growing faster than other spending:

https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iRmpgwAhQoLw/v1/-1x-1.png

This leads [some](https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/a-robin-hood-for-the-debt-crisis) to argue that student loan debt should be forgiven altogether. 

The "student debt jubilee" is a bad idea. It doesn't fix the dynamics that caused the debt crisis -- it instead shifts the cost burden from students to tax payers. In the long run, this would lead to *even higher tuitions*, because the students are not paying the price, and the colleges hold an implacable bargaining position.

Better solutions put a ceiling on the colleges' bargaining position against students. This can be done by various methods, but government intervention as done in other OECD countries leads to more reasonable prices:

https://media.salon.com/2017/09/screen_shot_2017-09-16_at_9.15.03_pm_0.png

### Fix urban housing prices

We saw that cities seem to be intrinsic to economic growth. Over time, a larger share of the total population has been living in cities.

Because the demand to live in cities is increasing, if we want to keep costs reasonable, we need to increase the supply of housing to match the increase. 

One way NOT to curb the urban housing crisis is [rent control](https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/07/opinion/reckonings-a-rent-affair.html) (eg. putting a ceiling on rent prices). Rent control [has been shown](https://web.stanford.edu/~diamondr/DMQ.pdf) to actually worsen the problem over time.

Instead, two better ways to curb housing costs are:  

- Liberalize zoning regulations. Current regulations prevent housing construction in metropolitan areas like NYC and San Francisco. This prevent housing supply to match the increasing demand.

- A [tax on the value of land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax). While we can build more housing in metropolitan areas, physics prevent us from adding more land. Taxing those who own socially valuable metropolitan land based on the value they are extracting from it redistributes this and helps reduce wealth inequality. 

It might seem strange that two seemingly similar problems (housing and college tuition costs) have one whose solution is more government intervention and the other more market liberalization. But the underlying economic dynamics that define how the problems are different, so there can't be a "one size fits all" answer here.

### Conclusion

The economic trends that defined the 2010s, like pessimistic job prospects or housing and college tuition costs, can be explained by how the nature of work has changed in the last 30 or so years.

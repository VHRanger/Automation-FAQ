One trend in the last decade has been increasing fears of AI and other machines automating away jobs. Whether it's [Elon Musk][1], a [US presidential candidates][2], or a [famous youtuber][3] there's serious concern that job automation could cause long run unemployment at massive scales.

Job automation underpins the explosion of economic growth we've seen since the 1830's [industrial revolution][4]. It's almost impossible to study any economic trend it creates in isolation, because the entire [labor market][5] has been tied to job automation for 200 years. Be skeptical of anyone selling a simple "grand unified theory" of automation's effect on unemployment. That person is either a crank or trying to sell you something.

This article will separate job automation facts from myths. There are large scale problems on the horizon, but they are probably not what you think they are. I'll also propose some solutions you should support to improve the future labor market.

# Part 1: The Facts

### 1) We automate tasks, not jobs

A job is made from of a bundle of tasks. For example, [O*NET][6] defines the job of [post-secondary architecture teacher][7] as including 21 tasks like advising students, preparing course materials and conducting original research.

Technology automates tasks, not jobs. Automating a task within a job doesn't necessarily mean the job will stop existing. It's hard to predict the effects -- the number of workers employed and the wage of those workers can go up or down depending on various economic factors as we'll see later on.

When you read an alarmist headline like ["Study finds nearly half of jobs are vulnerable to automation"][8], you need to put it in context: nearly half of all jobs **contain tasks ripe for automation**. Those jobs may or may not be at risk.

For example, some of an architecture professor's tasks are easier to automate (grading assignments) and others are harder (advising students). According to [Brynjolfsson and Mitchell][9] tasks "ripe for automation" are tasks where:

*   The task provides clear feedback with clearly definable goals and metrics

*   No specialized dexterity, physical skills, or mobility is required

*   Large digital datasets can be created containing input-output pairs for the task

*   No long chains of logic or reasoning that depend on diverse background knowledge or common sense

Some task are inherently hard automate. [Moravec's paradox][10] says that it's easier for a computer to learn to beat the best humans at chess or Starcraft than it is to do basic gardening on a windy afternoon. This is true even though almost all humans can do basic gardening and only a few can play chess at the highest levels.

The paradox is explained when we understand that gardening requires learning sensorimotor skills that mammals have evolved over billions of years, whereas learning Chess only means learning a short ruleset some humans developped when they were bored. This is true whether we're programming the computer manually or using the latest [deep learning][11] methods.

Some other tasks don't require dexterity, but require the sort of cross-task general intelligence that we [simply can't encode][12] into a machine process (with or without machine learning). "Conducting Original Research" is a good example of this.

Lastly, some tasks are simply bad candidates for automation because they're not very repetitive or too context driven for automation to be economic, as shown in [this XKCD comic:][13]

<img src="https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/automation_2x-296x300.png" alt="" width="394" height="400" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-879" />

### 2) Humans are not horses

CGP Grey's [Humans Need Not Apply][14] makes a famous argument: humans today are in the same position horses were in the 1910s. He says that humans will soon be entirely redundant and replaced by machines which can do everything a human can, but more efficiently.

This argument is wrong and uninformed.

Horses have only ever served very few economic tasks: transporting heavy loads, transporting humans faster than foot travel, and recreational uses. With the invention of the combustion engine, two of those three tasks are automated, and horses became almost exclusively a recreational object. This means horses populations decreased over time, because they were no longer needed for labor (the human equivalent to the horse depopulation would be mass, long term unemployment).

Humans can do lots of tasks ([O*NET][6] lists around 20,000). Even though most jobs contain some tasks that can be automated, [most tasks themselves are not suitable for automation][15], whether it's with machine learning or any other method.

It's also important to realize that automating a task means broader economic changes. It can change what jobs exist, by redefining which tasks are worth bundling together. It will also create entirely new tasks (eg. managing the new automated processes).

<img src="https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/automation-before-after-1024x653.png" alt="" width="660" height="421" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-897" />

Automating a task does not mean there is "one fewer" task to be done in the economy. This line of thinking is called the [lump of labor fallacy][16]. Any argument whose logic assumes there's a finite amount of work in the economy is fallacious and wrong.

The industrial revolution itself shows why the lump of labor fallacy is wrong.

Before the invention of the steam engine, more than [95% of humans were employed on farms][17], whereas today this number is around 2%. The remaining 93% of the population didn't disappear or go out of a job. Instead, automating farm work freed up the labor force to be put to more productive use over time. Some young laborers went to school instead of working on the family farm, while others started working in factories. Over time, the labor force reallocated away from agriculture.

**Sidenote:** The keen reader at this point will ask: *"if there's an infinite amount of work to be done in the economy, how is there any unemployment at all?"* The answer is that it takes some time to find a job. If everyone who wants work either has a job or is looking for work, the economy is said to be at the [natural rate of unemployment][18]. Unemployment rates above that number are consided to be a sign the country's economy is in a depression or unhealthy in some other manner.

### 3) Automation can help or hurt depending on who you are

If technology automates some important task in your job, the effect will differ depending on relevant economic factors: what job you do, where you are geographically, what your education level is, your level of wealth, and your social/professional network.

It's almost impossible to know a priori what the outcome will be. Let's take the example of a radiologist, where a core task of the job (making diagnoses based on X-Ray images) could be automated in the future. The scenario where all radiologists are unemployed overnight is unlikely -- they have at least [28 other tasks to work on][19] that still need doing. That said, several scenarios can play out:

*   Because their workload per client is reduced, radiologists can now see more clients. More patients use radiology services. More doctors enter radiology, or existing radiologists make more money.

*   People don't want/need more radiology services. Because a radiologist's workload is reduced, there are fewer radiologists. Existing radiologists become unemployed while looking for new specialties

*   People don't want/need more radiology services. Existing radiologists can't/don't find new specialties. We have as many radiologists, but they're paid less.

As we see, in the same case, our radiologist can end up making more money, less money and keep his job, or lose his job entirely. Which scenario plays out depends on economic factors like the [elasticity of supply/demand][20], the [substitution effect][21], the [income effect][22].

Here is another example. When ATMs were introduced to banks in the 1980s, people thought bank tellers would quickly stop existing. Over time, each bank branch did end up employing fewer tellers. However, ATMs made it cheaper to operate bank branches, so more bank branches opened and there were eventually [more bank teller jobs over all][23]:

<img src="https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bessenfig1.png" alt="" width="805" height="545" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-887" />

This shows that it's extremely difficult to predict the effect of automating a task on the workers who do that task.

### 4) Automation seems to increase inequality

Automating work makes the country richer on average in the long run. This doesn't mean that everyone will get richer -- automation can increase or decrease economic inequality. But it's important to note that **technological progress both increases wealth and changes the distribution of wealth**.

If a task gets automated, something is being made for cheaper than it used to. This can translate into lower prices, which shares the gains and lowers inequality. Automation can also translate into equivalent prices and higher profit margins, which increases inequality. Which scenario happens depends mainly on market concentration (AKA the companies' monopoly power).

Depressingly, inequality [has increased in the last 30 years.][24] This is at least partly because recent technological progress has served to increase, rather than decrease, inequality.

<img src="https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/saezzuckman.png" alt="" width="877" height="548" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-899" />

To understand what's going on, let's simplify the population to 3 socioeconomic classes: capital owners, high-education workers and low-education workers. The inequality between each of these is increasing.

The main trends are intra-worker inequality (the gap in income between high versus low education workers) and top income earner inequality (the inequality between capital owners and everyone else, often called the "1% vs the 99%").

First, the inequality between low-income and high-income workers [is increasing][25]:

<img src="https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/worker-inequality.png" alt="" width="825" height="528" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-902" />

Note the widening income gap between different groups of education. Also note this data shows high school dropout males haven't increased their wages compared to 1963.

This seems to be due to technology. Automation is mostly attacking tasks in what we would call ["middle income" jobs][26].

This fact makes sense with what we learned about Moravec's paradox in section 1. Lower income jobs are often manual and dexterous, and Moravec's Paradox means they are protected from being efficiently automated. On the other end of the scale, managerial and highly specialized tasks in jobs are of the kind that is often very domain driven and non-repetitive that makes them uneconomical to automate.

Second, the inequality between the very wealthiest in society and everyone else is also increasing since at least the 1980s, as we saw in the chart above.

It's not clear if the worsening top income inequality is entirely because of technological change. There are several trends that might push down the wages of regular workers compared to high income workers:

*   Firms may have increasing [monopsony][27] power over the workers. Because there are fewer firms, workers are in a worse bargaining position. This means lower wages overall than in a more competitive marketplace.

*   In most large cities, the cost of housing is outpacing the rate of wage growth. While a worker could have the same pay, the inequality between owners and non-owners will increase, and the share of income dedicated to housing will increasing (leaving disposable income lower).

*   In the US, healthcare prices far outpaces wage growth. This means higher health insurance premiums. While a worker's total compensation is increasing, the take-home pay is not increasing at the same rate due to the growing share going to health insurance.

We could also be automating more than is economically optimal [because of the tax treatment of capital investments][28]. This would reduce the wage of the workers because their bargaining power is reduced in the face of cheap money investing in inefficient automation.

### 5) If you're not a college graduate living in a city, automation probably hurt you

The best way to make this point is with the following [chart][25]

<img src="https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/urbancollege.png" alt="" width="823" height="606" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-903" />

The way to read the chart is as follows: each of the 3 charts represent a 20 year period with the x axis being the density of the city they work in, and the y axis the proportion of workers in that city with that education level.

What this chart shows is clear: the labor force is **moving to cities** and **increasing in education**. Take these facts and put them in the context of of the rising gap in income between high and low education workers and rising urban housing prices.

This paints a bleak picture for everyone who isn't college educated and working in a large city: lowering wages and diminishing economic prospects.

### 6) Landlords and Colleges are big winners from the above facts

A lot of [ink has been spilled][29] trying to explain the explosion of healthcare prices in the united states. In both health care, education and urban housing the price has grown at a multiple of average income:

<img src="https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/How_Have_Rents_Changed_Since_1960__rej5gh.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-905" />

The common issue is bargaining power. You can't negotiate with a hospital when your health is on the line.

Similarly, it's increasingly a necessity to both have a college degree and live near a large city to make a good living. As one [economist jokes][30]: *"I can take all my papers globally replace hospitals with schools, doctors with teachers and patients with students"*. The same is true with urban housing, landlords and renters.

Getting a college degree leads to much higher wages. This means people are ready to pay more for a college degree. Colleges see the value of their product sold increase. Colleges increase prices to match the new value and pocket the difference.

The same dynamic applies with housing in large cities. The demand for metro-area housing is increasing sharply, and the supply is not growing much, due to zoning regulations and other NIMBY politics. Over time, those who own existing urban residences will profit at the expense of all others.

Explanations that get lost in details about college administrative costs or larger home sizes lose the forest for the trees. The administrative costs and larger homes are a way in which the value of a college degree is being captured, not a fundamental cause.

### 7) The market value of a college diploma has massively increased

A college diploma provides 3 main benefits: hard knowledge, social connections, and a market signal (proof that you can complete a university degree). The economic value of the diploma is going to be a ratio of those 3 factors depending on the exact diploma [footnote] For instance, an engineering degree might provide lots of hard knowledge, little connections and a decent market signal from being officially a professional engineer. On the other hand, a MBA might mostly provide social connections [/footnote].

It's arguable that the hard knowledge being learned in school is has not changed in the last few decades. Standardized test scores aren't a perfect measure, but they suggest we're not learning much more than we used to:

<img src="https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Capture.png" alt="" width="618" height="513" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-910" />

School curricula have not changed at a pace that can justify the increase in price. Similarly, it's hard to honestly argue that students meet exponentially more peers in college now than they did in the 1960s. So hard knowledge and social connections have a hard time explaining increasing college costs.

However, both the wages of those graduating college, and the cost of going to college are growing fast.

This leads to one conclusion: *the market value of the signal a college degree provides has massively increased in the last 30 years.*

It's not clear why the signal is worth more. But it doesn't mean we can't do something about it! We've known about market signalling [since the 1970s][31]. An important insight in the topic is that the cost of the signal is bore by the one emitting the signal. In education terms this implies colleges can charge more and that the student are necessarily the ones footing the bill.

### 8) Automation and free trade have similar effects on labor

This is a sidenote, but will help organize your thoughts on economic trends.

In both the cases of free trade and automation, we replace what was previously done by labor with capital. For trade, we do it by giving the money to people in an other country in exchange for the task being completed. For automation, we do it by giving money to people to make machines to complete the task.

There is a [strong argument][32] that trade has had a much larger impact on employment in the US in the last 20 years. The reason for this is that [trade with China][33] has had a large effect on US manufacturing employment, much [more so than automation][34].

Both trade and automation are fundamental drivers of modern economic growth. Both create more wealth, but also change the distribution of income in society, which often increase inequality. Even the [simplest trade models][35] predict that inequality increases -- trade creates winners and losers, but winners always [gain more than losers lose][36].

[Autor, Dorn & Hansen (2016)][37] put it best:

> In response to a given trade shock, a lower-wage employee experiences larger proportionate reductions in annual and lifetime earnings, a diminished ability to exit a job before an adverse shock hits, and a greater likelihood of exiting the labor market, relative to her higher-wage coworker.

In theory, we could compensate the ones losing from trade or automation by taxing the winners' increased wealth, but in practice this generally seems lost in the political process

### 9) Rural communities do not recover well to unemployment shocks

[Autor, Dorn & Hansen][37] show that rural communities with an economy vulnerable to trade with China (AKA factory towns) have had lower wages and labor force participation a full decade after the "China shock" on their local economy. This paints a bleak picture for the ones living in the affected communities -- while we would expect the losers from a trade deal to eventually find equivalent work in other economic sectors, those in rural communities often don't.

It's important to note the other side of this issue. China entering in trade with the global market is one of the greatest welfare gains in recorded human history. It's hard to overstate the impact: it has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty. China's poverty rate fell from [88 percent in 1981 to 0.7 percent in 2015][38]. Human suffering has been reduced on an unprecedented historic scale in China.

The issue with trade is that in the same event we can lift hundreds of millions of Chinese out of poverty, raise US GDP overall while also economically eviscerating some US rural manufacturing towns. Yet, somehow, we don't adequately compensate the latter from any of the of the hundreds of billions of dollars worth of gains in any of the former.

The "China Shock" is an outstanding event, but the overall trend of economic productivity going from rural areas towards urban areas is ongoing, and the rural areas don't seem to adapt well to this change.

* * *

# TAKEAWAYS:

**Don't be concerned about hypothetical future unemployment.**

**Instead, be concerned about low quality job prospects right now.**

Automation creates a lot of economic prosperity. However, this prosperity is not shared equally. When we automate something, it's possible some are worse off afterwards.

We've seen that while automation is the core engine for economic growth in the last 200 years, in the last 30 years automation has also increased inequality. While we shouldn't be concerned about humans becoming economically useless, we should be concerned about large demographics **feeling useless** due to dire job prospects.

The two groups that are doing well are the highly educated urbanites and "the rich" (roughly the top 0.1% or 1% of the wealth distribution). Both of these groups, but especially the ultra-rich, have had great run of increasing income.

Rural demographics and those with low education have had it the worst. It's not a coincidence that rural inhabitants with low education is one of the only demographics in the last century whose life expectancy [has worsened][39]. This increase in mortality is mostly due to "deaths of despair" (suicide, drug overdose, etc. )

Urban dwellers without a college education are also not particularly better off. Their income is not growing particularly fast. On the other hand, urban costs of living,especially housing, but also education and healthcare rising faster than the income growth.

In short, we're worrying about the imaginary issues automation might cause when there are very real economic issues automation right now. Let's focus on those.

* * *

# Part 2: Solutions

[Furman (2016)][40] proposes the following solutions:

*   Keep investing in AI because the benefits massively outweigh the negatives.

*   Ensure more widely accessible and flexible education for all to prepare for jobs of the future

*   Aid workers in job transitions

*   Ensure that the benefits of automation are broadly shared

Anyone who read up to this point should agree with the above. Here is additional discussion on some popularly proposed solutions:

### Universal Basic Income is not a particularly good answer to automation's problems

From [Elon Musk][41] to Andrew Yang (Source), many advocate for Universal Basic Income (UBI) to act as a safety net against technological unemployment.

UBI isn't necessarily a bad idea [footnote] UBI is can be mathematically equivalent to most welfare system with taxes coming in and welfare checks coming out. The advantages of UBI are that it's simpler to understand and might be lighter on bureaucracy. The important part is how much we tax and give out at each level of income. In UBI, we give everyone money unconditionally. If we want to help the poor, then comparing to other systems we need to tax less at lower income brackets, and tax more at higher inome brackets, so that the "gift" is offset by higher taxes. [/footnote]. But we saw before that the problem with automation isn't technological unemployment, it's low quality job prospects from a shifting economy.

UBI, like any other generous social safety net, helps those out of a job. However it doesn't specifically address the root cause (economic mobility) so it's not helping with the long term negative trends we discussed.

### College debt forgiveness is not a good solution to the student loan crisis

We saw in sections 8 and 9 that the bargaining power of colleges against students has increased and this lets them charge much larger prices than they used to. This adds up to student loans growing faster than other spending:

<img src="https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1x-1.png" alt="" width="1200" height="733" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-915" />

In response to that, [some][42] to argue that student loan debt should be forgiven altogether.

The "student debt jubilee" is a bad idea. It doesn't fix the dynamics that caused the debt crisis -- it instead shifts the cost burden from students to tax payers. In the long run, this would lead to *even higher tuitions*. Because the students are not paying the price, and the colleges hold an implacable bargaining position.

Better solutions put a ceiling on the colleges' bargaining position against students. This can be done by various methods, but government intervention as done in other OECD countries leads to more reasonable prices:

<img src="https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/screen_shot_2017-09-16_at_9.15.03_pm_0.png" alt="" width="480" height="362" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-916" />

### Fix urban housing prices

We saw that cities seem to be intrinsic to economic growth. Over time, a larger share of the total population is living in cities.

Because the demand to live in cities is increasing, if we want to keep costs reasonable, we need to increase the supply of housing to match the increase.

One way NOT to curb the urban housing crisis is [rent control][43] (eg. putting a ceiling on rent prices). Rent control [has been shown][44] to actually worsen the problem over time.

Instead, two better ways to curb housing costs are:

*   Liberalize zoning regulations. Current regulations prevent housing construction in metropolitan areas like NYC and San Francisco. This prevent housing supply to match the increasing demand.

*   A [tax on the value of land][45]. While we can build more housing in metropolitan areas, physics prevent us from adding more land. Taxing those who own socially valuable metropolitan land based on the value they are extracting from it redistributes this and helps reduce wealth inequality.

### Conclusion

The economic trends that defined the 2010s, like pessimistic job prospects or housing and college tuition costs, can be explained by how the nature of work has changed in the last 30 or so years.

It might seem strange that two seemingly similar problems that result from the labor market shift (housing and college tuition costs) have such different solutions. One whose solution is more government intervention and the other more market liberalization. But the underlying economic dynamics that define how the problems are different, so there can't be a "one size fits all" answer here. This is why understanding the economic dynamics is important.

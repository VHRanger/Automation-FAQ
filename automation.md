Automation is when we use technology to make a task that was previously done by a human redundant.

For a few years now, there have been fears about automation's effect on the availability and quality of jobs to humans. From [Elon Musk][1] to [US presidential candidates][2], or [famous youtubers][3] there's serious concern that automation, especially with recent developments in AI, might cause long run unemployment at massive scales.

This FAQ will explain the effects of automation, and debunk myths surrounding it. We'll also propose some policies you should support that the experts think can help.

Automation includes almost all technological progress since the first [industrial revolution][4]. It's such a broad topic, we can hardly to talk about the economic effects of automating work without talking about the broader [economics of labor][5].

There are multiple dimensions to automating work -- be skeptical of anyone trying to sell a simple "grand unified theory" of automation's effect on unemployment. Such a person is uninformed or trying to sell you something.

# Part 1: The Facts

### 1) We automate tasks, not jobs

A job is made from of a bundle of tasks. For example, [O*NET][6] defines the job of [post-secondary architecture teacher][7] as made up of 21 tasks including ones like:

*   Advise students on academic and vocational curricula and on career issues

*   Prepare course materials

*   Conduct research in a particular field of knowledge and publish findings

Technology automates tasks, not jobs. When you read an alarmist headline like ["Study finds nearly half of jobs are vulnerable to automation"][8], you need to put it in context: nearly half of all jobs **contain tasks ripe for automation**.

Some of an architecture professor's tasks are easier to automate (grading assignments) and others are much harder (advising students, conducting original research). According to [Brynjolfsson and Mitchell][9] tasks "ripe for automation" are tasks that:

*   The task provides clear feedback with clearly definable goals and metrics

*   Large digital datasets can be created containing input-output pairs for the task

*   No long chains of logic or reasoning that depend on diverse background knowledge or common sense

*   No specialized dexterity, physical skills, or mobility required

Some tasks are extremely difficult to automate with machine learning due to [Moravec's paradox][10]. Counterintuitively, it's easier for a computer to learn to beat grandmaster humans at chess or Starcraft than it is to do gardening on a windy afternoon, even though most humans can do the second, but very few can do the first. The paradox is explained when we understand that gardening requires learning sensorimotor skills that mammals have evolved over billions of years, whereas learning Chess only means learning a short ruleset some humans developped when they were bored.

Other tasks don't require dexterity, but require the sort of cross-task general intelligence that we [simply can't encode][11] into a machine process (with or without machine learning); "Conducting Original Research" is a good example.

Lastly, some tasks are simply bad candidates for automation because they're not very repetitive and too context driven for automation to be economic:

**----> /XKCD PLOT <-----**

Automating a task within a job doesn't mean the job will stop existing. It's impossible to predict the effects -- the number of people employed and the wage of those workers can both go up or down depending on economic factors we'll discuss in section **XXX**.

### 2) Humans are not horses

CGP Grey's [Humans Need Not Apply][12] makes a famous argument: humans today are in the same position horses were in the 1910s. That is, humans are about to be entirely redundant and replaced by machines which can do everything a human can, but more efficiently.

This argument is wrong and uninformed. Horses have only ever served very few economic tasks: transporting heavy loads, transporting humans faster than foot travel, and recreational uses. With the invention of the combustion engine, two of those three tasks are automated, and horses became almost exclusively a recreational object. This means horses populations decreased over time, because they were no longer needed for labor (the human equivalent to that depopulation would be mass, long term unemployment).

Humans can do lots of tasks ([O*NET][6] lists around 20,000). Even though most jobs contain some tasks that can be automated, [most tasks themselves are not suitable for automation][13], with machine learning or otherwise.

It's also important to realize that automating a task means broader economic changes. It can change what jobs exist, by redefining which tasks are worth bundling together. It can create entirely new tasks (eg. managing the new automated processes).

**-------> Tasks graphic <------------**

After automation, some of those tasks are replaced with robot heads (automation) The job definitions shift and new tasks are created (some are related to managing automated tasks)

**-------> / Tasks graphic <---------**

Automating a task does not mean there is "one fewer" task to be done in the economy. This line of thinking is called the [lump of labor fallacy][14]. Any argument whose logic assumes there's a finite amount of work in the economy is incorrect because of that fallacy.

A classic example showing why this is wrong is the industrial revolution. Before the invention of the steam engine more than [95% of humans were employed on farms][15], whereas today this number is around 2%. The remaining 93% of the population didn't go out of a job -- automating this work freed up the labor force to be put to more productive use over time. Some went to school instead of working on the family farm, some started working in factories, etc. Over time, the labor force reallocated away from agriculture.

At this point, the smart reader might ask: *"if there's an infinite amount of work to be done in the economy, how is there any unemployment at all?"* This is a deep question, which we'll touch in section **XXX**.

### 3) Automation can help or hurt depending on who you are

If technology automates some important task in your job, the effect will be different different depending on your economic status. The main factors are what job you do, where you are geographically, what your education level is, your level of wealth and your social connections.

It's almost impossible to know a priori what the effect will be. Let's take the example of a radiologist, where a core task of the job (making diagnoses based on X-Ray images) is [soon automated](). What won't happen is "radiologists don't exist anymore" -- they have [28 other tasks to work on][16] which aren't automated. That said, several scenarios can play out:

*   A radiologist now sees many additional clients, because their workload per client is reduced. Existing radiologists make more money.

*   People don't want/need more radiology services. Because a radiologist's workload is reduced, there are fewer radiologists. Existing radiologists become unemployed while looking for new specialties

*   People don't want/need more radiology services. Existing radiologists can't/don't find new specialties. We have as many radiologists, but they're paid less.

As we see, in the same case, our radiologist can end up making more money, less money and keep his job, or lose his job entirely. Which scenario plays out depends on economic factors like the [elasticity of supply/demand][17], the [substitution effect][18], the [income effect][19].

Here is another example. When ATMs were introduced to banks, people thought bank tellers would quickly stop existing. While each bank branch employed fewer tellers, more bank branches opened, and there were eventuallly [more bank teller jobs over all][20]

--> graph of ATM vs bank tellers here https://voxeu.org/sites/default/files/image/FromMay2014/bessenfig1.png <----

This is to show that it's extremely difficult to predict the effect of automating a task on the workers who do that task a priori. Because automation is a wide-ranging force in the economy, the most effective way to learn which scenarios play out is to instead study the trends in the labor force. This is what we'll do in the next few sections.

### 4) Automation seems to increase inequality

Automating work will always make the country richer on average. This doesn't mean that everyone will get richer -- automation can increase or decrease inequality. But it's important to know that **technological progress always changes the distribution of wealth**. Even if a new technology is a clear improvement on all fronts, the ones profiting from the existing system will be losers. If we made a perfectly clean and renewable energy source, the people profiting from fossil fuels would be poorer, and the distribution of wealth would change to be more equal.

However, as seen in the [inequality FAQ][21], inequality has increased in the last 30 years. This is at least partly because recent technological progress has served to increase, rather than decrease, inequality.

**----> SOME PLOT HERE SHOWING INEQUALITY BAD VERY SAD <-----**

probably from saez & Zucman 2014

https://gabriel-zucman.eu/files/SaezZucman2014.pdf

**----> / SOME PLOT HERE SHOWING INEQUALITY BAD VERY SAD <-----**

There are 3 demographics between which inequality is increasing due to technology: capital owners, high-education workers and low-education workers. We can separate these trends between intra-worker inequality (the gap in income between high versus low education workers) and top income earner inequality (often called the "99% versus the 1%").

First, the inequality between low-income and high-income workers is increasing:

**---> Plot showing bottom 20% vs top 20% income figure 2 from here https://economics.mit.edu/files/16724 <--**

This seems to be due to technology. Automation is mostly attacking tasks in what we would call "middle income" jobs (DAVID AUTOR SOURCE). This fact makes sense with what we learned in section 2. On one hand, lower income jobs are often very manual and dexterous, and Moravec's Paradox protects them from being efficiently automated. On the other end of the scale, managerial and highly specialized tasks in jobs are of the kind that is often very domain driven and non-repetitive that makes them uneconomical to automate.

Second, the inequality between the wealthiest in society and everyone else is also increasing since at least the 1980s:

**----> image 1% vs everyone else <-----**

It's not clear if the worsening top income inequality is entirely because of technological change. There are several trends that might push down the wages of regular workers compared to high income workers:

*   Firms have increasing monopsony power (source) over the workers. Because there are increasingly fewer firms, workers are in a worse barganing position. This means lower wages overall than in a more competitive marketplace.

*   In most large cities, the cost of housing is outpacing the rate of wage growth. While a worker could have the same pay, the inequality between owners and non-owners will increase, and the share of income dedicated to housing will increasing (leaving disposable income lower).

*   In the US, healthcare prices far outpaces wage growth. This means higher health insurance premiums. While a worker's total compensation is increasing, the take-home pay is not increasing at the same rate due to the growing share going to health insurance.

However, we could be automating more than is economically optimal [because of the tax treatment of capital investments][22]. This would reduce the wage of the workers because their bargaining power is reduced in the face of cheap money investing in inefficient automation.

So while

### 5) Automation makes it harder to match your skills to a job

Automation probably hurts workers and might create a skill mismatch (Acemoglu & Restreppo) : https://www.nber.org/papers/w24196.pdf

More evidence of this in the Beveridge Curve shift

### 6) If you're not a college graduate living in a city, automation probably hurt you

The simplest way to make this point is with the following hard-to-read figure from [here][23]

---> figure 9 from here https://economics.mit.edu/files/16724 <---

The way to read this plot is as follows: each of the 3 charts represent a 20 year period with the x axis being the density of the city they work in, and the y axis the proportion of workers in that city with that education level.

What this chart shows is clear: the labor force is **moving to cities** and **increasing in education**. Take these facts and put them in the context of of the rising gap in income between high and low education workers and rising urban housing prices (see previous section). This paints a bleak picture for everyone who isn't college educated and working in a large city: lowering wages and diminishing economic prospects.

### 7) Landlords and Colleges are big winners from the above facts

A lot of [ink has been spilled][24] trying to explain the explosion of healthcare prices in the united states. In both health care, education and urban housing the price has grown at a multiple of average income:

---> Chart of education, healthcare, and urban housing vs real wages

https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/college_scost.png

https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/rent-growth-since-1960/

<---

The common issue is bargaining power. In the same way that someone can't negotiate with a hospital when his health is on the line, it's increasingly a necessity to both have a college degree and live near a large city to make a good living. As one [economist joked][25]: *"I could just take all my papers and statistical programs and globally replace hospitals with schools, doctors with teachers and patients with students"*.

The price of education is not increasing because education is getting better:

https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/primary_scost.gif

It's increasing *because people are ready to pay more for a degree*. Here's a simple explanation of the dynamic:

Getting a college degree leads to much higher wages. This means people are ready to pay more for a college degree. Colleges see the value of their product sold increase. Colleges increase prices to match the new value and pocket the difference.

The same dynamic applies with housing in large cities. Explanations that get lost in details about college administrative costs and larger home sizes lose the forest for the trees: the administrative costs are a way in which the value of a college degree is being captured, not a fundamental cause.

## TAKEAWAYS: 

### Don't be concerned about hypothetical future unemployment. Do be concerned about low quality job prospects right now.

We've seen that while automation is the core engine for economic growth in the last 200 years, in the last 30 years automation has also increased inequality. While we shouldn't be concerned about humans becoming economically useless, we should be concerned about large demographics **feeling useless** due to dire job prospects. 

This is especially true for rural demographics and those with low education. It's not a coincidence that this is one of the few demographics in the last century whose life expectancy [has worsened](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/casetextsp17bpea.pdf): these are so-called "deaths of despair".

# Part 2: Solutions



According to [Furman (2016)](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/documents/Artificial-Intelligence-Automation-Economy.PDF) 

- Keep investing in AI because the benefits massively outweigh the negatives.

- Ensure more widely accessible and flexible education for all to prepare for jobs of the future

- Aid workers in job transitions

- Ensure that the benefits of automation are broadly shared

### XXX) Universal Basic Income is not a good answer to automation's problems

Universal Basic Income (UBI) isn't necessarily a bad idea.

[Elon Musk][27] and Andrew Yand (Source).

UBI is exactly equivalent to a normal welfare system with taxes coming in and cash-based welfare programs or a [negative income tax bracket][26] coming out. The only real difference in theory is that UBI is simpler to explain and might be simpler on the bureaucracy required.
